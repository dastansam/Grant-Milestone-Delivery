**The [invoice form :pencil:](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmNYaoCgrxyhzgoKQ0ynQvnNRoTmgApz9NrMp-hd8mhIiO0A/viewform) has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/Support%20Docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/contracts-tool.md
* **Milestone Number:** 2

**Context** (optional)
> Please provide a short paragraph or two connecting the deliverables in this milestone and describing their purpose.

**Deliverables**
> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work. 
> 
> If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective `Notes` column.

The current approach is to test on branches: [v1.0.0](https://github.com/paritytech/smart-bench/tree/v1.0.0) is compatible with polkadot release v1.0.0 and branch [v1.7.0](https://github.com/paritytech/smart-bench/tree/v1.7.0) is compatible with polkadot release v1.7.0. To run benchmark go to [GHA](https://github.com/paritytech/smart-bench/actions/workflows/benchmark.yml), select `Run workflow` and branch (v1.0.0 or v1.7.0). Results are visible in [README.md v1.0.0](https://github.com/paritytech/smart-bench/blob/v1.0.0/README.md)/[README.md v1.7.0](https://github.com/paritytech/smart-bench/blob/v1.7.0/README.md) file and [gh_pages](https://github.com/paritytech/smart-bench/tree/gh-pages)|

**Additional Information**
> Any further comments on the milestone that you would like to share with us.

Benchmarks do not work on newest polkadot releases >= 1.8.0 due to the issue:
