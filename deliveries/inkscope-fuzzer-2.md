* **Milestone Number:** 2

**Context** (optional)

Our fuzzer has now reached its first version and is finished in terms of core functionality. 

It has undergone testing against the [ityfuzz challenge](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3597926.3598059), contracts created by our team, as well as some [vulnerable contracts](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout/tree/main/test-cases) created by Coinfabrik.

Two modes of operation are available - a console mode and a more user-friendly terminal user interface (TUI) mode, allowing users to interact with the fuzzer in their preferred manner. 

With this initial version complete, we are confident in the fuzzer's capabilities and excited to see it put to use in identifying vulnerabilities within ink! smart contracts.
